1. Herfindahl Index (H)
Formula: H = Σ(share²) where share = provider's claims / total claims for code
Addresses: Market concentration - how monopolized is this service?

2. Provider Scarcity (S)
Formula: S = 1 - (n/N) where n = providers offering code, N = total providers
Addresses: Provider availability - how few providers offer this service?

3. Inverse Prevalence (P)
Formula: P = 1 - (percentile/100) where percentile = code's volume rank
Addresses: Volume rarity - how uncommon is this service by volume?

Composite Rarity Score
Formula: Rarity = (H × S × P)^(1/3) (geometric mean)

Example: Lung Transplant
