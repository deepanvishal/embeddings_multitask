Title:
Provider Utilization Embeddings: Foundational Representation for Network Analytics
Bullets (Crisp, Non-Rambling)

We built a provider-level utilization embedding that summarizes each provider’s procedure mix, diagnosis mix, cost patterns, place of service, and patient volume into a compact vector representation.

This embedding serves as a foundational, reusable asset for any downstream modeling or analytics — including ProNet 2.0, provider substitution, network simulation, and utilization pattern analysis.

Data Window: Claims from 2023–2024.

Initial Cohort: ~60,000 provider entities.

Focus: Hospitals and facilities only (specialists excluded in this phase).

Stability Filters Applied:

≥ 156 total claims

≥ 10 distinct treatment codes

≥ 8 distinct diagnosis codes

Filters chosen based on empirical distribution breakpoints to ensure stable utilization signals.

Final Modeling Cohort: 25,347 providers that meet minimum utilization diversity and volume thresholds.

The goal at this stage is not to tie the embeddings to an immediate metric, but to deliver a consistent, scalable provider representation that other teams can use directly.


SLIDE 1: OVERVIEW
Overview
Representing providers based on their utilization patterns is complicated due to high dimensionality from thousands of procedure and diagnosis codes, resulting in extremely sparse data. We're creating embeddings to solve this challenge.
Scope

Data Source: 2023-2024 claims data
Provider Type: Hospitals and facilities only (no specialists)
Initial Pool: 60,000+ providers in claims
Final Cohort: 25,347 providers after filtering
Filtering Criteria:

Minimum 156 claims per provider
At least 10 unique procedure codes
At least 8 unique diagnosis codes



Solution: ME2Vec (Medical Entity to Vector)

Graph-based embeddings that capture provider utilization patterns
Converts sparse procedure/diagnosis codes into dense vector representations
Enables efficient similarity calculations between providers

Output

Dense embeddings for each provider
Any team can use for their analytics needs
First application: ProNet 2.0 network simulation
